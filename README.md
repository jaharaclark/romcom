# 'RomCom'. a project that actually has nothing to do with romantic comedies.
### Brought to you by Marika Shanahan & Jahara Clark

## Need to know what it is?
In the mood for a romantic comedy? Then this is not what you're looking for. Romcom is a conglomerate of romantic novel book covers. The platform lets the user generate a random cover based on a cover image, title, and two descriptors. OR! {spoiler alert} the user can input a cover image, title and descriptors of their choice and watch their special cover come to life. When the user finds a cover that's a particular fav, they're able to click the 'save' button which will not only allow them to view the saved cover later, but the unique cover image, title and quote can then be used to generate random covers at will.

## Wanna see it in action?
Open it using 'open index.html' from this project folder and check it out for yourself. Don't forget to create your own cover.

## What did we use?
In this project, we were simply manipulating the Javascript main.js file as all of the HTML and CSS were provided. However we did need to reference the HTML in order to display both new random and user generated posters.

## Questions how we struggled?
Though plagued by syntax errors at the most opportune moments, all iterations were able to be completed to functionality and refactored to the best of our abilities. 

## How to use it?
No further installation is necessary upon downloading the repository to your local machine and using the terminal to open the index.html file in your browser. Though please keep in mind that each time the page reloads any data or changes from the previous session will not be saved.
